# MUSA611_Midterm
Repository for MUSA611 midterm for Scott Mullarkey

My story map describes the results of the 2018 Point-In-Time (PIT) count for the state of New Jersey.  This is an annual count of the 
states homeless population.  Title and narratives on each slide provide details on three different segments of the count: total homeless, 
chronically homeless, and unsheltered homeless.  There is a next/back button to transition between slides.  There is also a map reset 
button which will restore the original settings of the map without having to transition out of the slide or refresh the page…in case you 
zoom or move map.  User can ‘click’ on a county polygon and it will zoom in and center while providing a popup showing how that county 
contributed to the overall state results (just lists county on the first/intro slide…others provide county counts).  A legend on the 
bottom right corner of the map shows what color representations are for each polygon.  Things hide and show based on slide transitions.  
Regarding the code…I tried to add in comments throughout to explain what different lines are doing.  I also added in a resource list on 
the bottom which shows different web sources I used (quite a few).  Overall I am happy with the story map.  If I had a little more time 
I’d probably spend it on breaking up the side bar narrative.  It currently only separates the title and text portions.  I would have liked 
to have broken up the text portion with line breaks but didn’t get a chance to figure that out.  Time was well spent though on working 
through the functionality of the map.
